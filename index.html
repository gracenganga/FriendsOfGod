        <h2>God doesn't work in the timeline of man</h2>
        <p>God's power is limitless and cannot be confined to work at a certsin time in a certain way.</p>

                <h3>Waiting season</h3>
                <p>We all have something we are trusting God for, is it marriage, a job, a child, this or that breakthrough. Sometimes what we are waiting for takes time for it to come to pass for it to happen. The waiting season.

This season is very crutial. Our faith is tried at such a time. We cannot wait to see the end of such a season. We find ourselves telling God, "God if You don't do this at such and such a time, then You are not God. I will not trust Your sovereign power."The restlessness within us. "God, why can I not have this? Why are others having this so easily? Yet it's such a struggle for me. God, how long?" We feel that if this doesn't happen now, it's the end for us. "God, time is going by; I am not getting any younger. My mates are way ahead of me." It is important that we know that sometimes these breakthroughs are not just for us, but also for others; sometimes this will end a generational pattern until the time is right; only then will it happen.God wants your story to change the lives of others; a generation is waiting. You having it prematurely means that the impact of your breakthrough will not be as it was supposed to. God will not move by your threats; His ways are not our ways, nor are His thoughts our thoughts. Surrender to Him; trust Him. As hard as this may sound, you must wait on Him.Imagine the Israelites after God saved them from slavery; He was taking them to Canaan, their promised land. But before then, they had to go through the wilderness. The wilderness you are going through may be different from that of the Israelites. But remember, their wilderness season was prolonged because they failed to trust God; they chose to disobey, to murmur, and we too have a choice; let us choose God. Beyond the fear, the lack, and the ridicule, trust God.Not only was their time in the wilderness prolonged, but none of them saw the land of Canaan/experienced it except Moses, who saw it, and Joshua and Caleb, who brought a good report. What was supposed to be theirs to live in and the generations to come only became their children's. God is faithful, but are we playing our part of trust and obedience? May we not miss His promises to us and our blessings due to our distrust and disobedience. May we turn our hearts murmurs to praise and thanksgiving unto God.</p>
